## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability, like a trusted medical institution.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very light tint of the primary color to offer a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Violet (#8E24AA) to bring a different tint that provides enough contrast to draw the user's eye to key elements without disrupting the professional and reliable mood.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean and modern user interface.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different types of information (e.g., checkmarks for verified fields, warning signs for potential issues).
- Employ a clear, intuitive layout with a prominent upload button and easily understandable results.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback to the user, such as a loading animation while processing images.
